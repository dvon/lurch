# Lurch

Lurch is a software testing tool developed as a part of my PhD research project.
Here's a link to a copy of the old website: <https://dvon.github.io/lurch/>.

Included in the site is my attempt to explain some common temporal logic properties,
together with B&uuml;chi automata representing violations of those properties:
